## Hi there 👋

My name is Liam and I’m a software engineer who specialises in full-stack web development.

I work at a digital product agency called [Potato](https://p.ota.to) where I’ve helped build and maintain purposeful and effective solutions for clients such as Google, Mozilla, and RBS.

In my spare time I play piano, guitar, bass and drums, and am a keen student of music theory. I enjoy generative and interactive art – don’t get me started on the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) ❤️
