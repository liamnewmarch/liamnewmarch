## Hello, world 👋

My name is Liam and I make things for the web. I live in Yorkshire and love hackable hardware, open source software, generative art, and music theory.

I work as a Staff Specialist Engineer at AKQA Leap (formerly Potato), and have built sites and apps for the likes of Google, Mozilla, and RBS.

I’m also a self-taught musician and play guitar, bass, piano and drums. I’m very interested in music theory, audio engineering and recording, and spend way too much time tinkering with the Web Audio API ❤️
